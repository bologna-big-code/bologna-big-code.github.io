The [Italian National Agency for New Technologies, Energy and Sustainable Economic Development](https://www.enea.it/) (ENEA) and the [Department of Computer Science of the University of Bologna](https://disi.unibo.it/it) (DISI), in collaboration with [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) (SH) and with the support of the [International Foundation Big Data and Artificial Intelligence for Human Development](https://www.ifabfoundation.org/) (iFAB), promote the **Bologna Big Code Lab** project, which aims *to explore new methods for the automatic and secure development of codes* and *to create opportunities for training and dissemination of the new digital technologies*.
 
The **Bologna Big Code Lab** is inspired by the presence, at the [ENEA Research Center in Bologna](https://www.bologna.enea.it/), of the first European institutional mirror of [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/), the universal source code archive, an ambitious and far-reaching initiative promoted by the French national institute for computer science research [Inria](https://www.inria.fr/en) in cooperation with [UNESCO](https://www.unesco.it/). 

The goal of [Software Heritage](https://www.softwareheritage.org/) is to *collect, preserve and make accessible* the software publicly available to the world: as the library of Alexandria was born to preserve the knowledge of the ancient world, this modern digital library collects and preserves a heritage expression of the genius, intelligence and culture of humanity.
